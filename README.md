My name is Darius Rückert, I am 26 years old, and living in the beautiful city Erlangen (Germany). Since March 2018 I am full-time PhD student at the Visual Computing Lab of the Friedrich Alexander University Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU). My main ressearch topics are 3D reconstruction, SLAM, real-time rendering, and optimization. 

## Active Projects

 * Implementing and integrating a code generator for templated cost-functors into ceres. [Gerrit](https://ceres-solver-review.googlesource.com/q/status:open), [Ceres](http://ceres-solver.org/) 
 * FragmentFusion: A light-weight SLAM pipeline for dense reconstruction. [Paper](paper/FragmentFusion.pdf) [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DK7tvu2nw24)
 * Snake-SLAM. A sparse indirect SLAM system for real-time camera localization. Will be presented at the SLAM-Workshop of ISMAR 2019.
 * 3D reconstruction of a roman vessel for the "Professorship of Ancient History". [Homepage](https://www.egea-ev.de/), [Homepage2](https://www.geschichte.phil.fau.de/department-geschichte/lehrstuehle-und-personen/professur-fuer-alte-geschichte/)
 * Lib Saiga: A lightweight utility and rendering framework [source](https://github.com/darglein/saiga)
