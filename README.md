My name is Darius Rückert, I am 26 years old, and living in the beautiful city Erlangen (Germany). Since March 2018 I am full-time PhD student at the Visual Computing Lab of the Friedrich Alexander University Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU). My current ressearch topics are real-time 3D reconstruction, SLAM, non-linear optimization, and deep learning in rendering.

## Active Projects

 * Point-based neural rendering on laser-scanned indoor datasets
 * Implementing and integrating a code generator for templated cost-functors into ceres. [Gerrit](https://ceres-solver-review.googlesource.com/q/status:open), [Ceres](http://ceres-solver.org/) 
 * Snake-SLAM. A sparse indirect SLAM system for real-time camera localization.
 * Lib Saiga: A lightweight utility and rendering framework [source](https://github.com/darglein/saiga)
 * 3D reconstruction of the "Kemenate" and interior objects in "Schloss Thurnau"
